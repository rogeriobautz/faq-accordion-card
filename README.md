## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned:

- That transition in CSS does not work with properties set to auto.
- How to add/remove/toggle a class of an element parent using javascript
- Escope in js function

### Continued development

I create the logic to make the accordion work the way I wanted - only one answer is shown at the time. I need to study and to practice JavaScript more.
